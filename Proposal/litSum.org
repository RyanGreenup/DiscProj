** Skimming and summary
*** From Paper
**** DONE [#A] Stable Algorithms for Link Analysis cite:ngStableAlgorithmsLink2001 :modification:insight:eigenvalue:
Investigates under what situations the pagerank of a matrix is resistant to perturbations of a graph, finding essentially that distance of $\lambda_{2}$ from 1 is important.

A new algorithm is suggested
**** DONE [#A] The second EigenValue of the Google Matrix cite:haveliwalaSecondEigenvalueGoogle2003,zhaoOptimizingNodeDiscovery2019 :eigenvalue:
Determine analytically the modulus of the second EigenValue for the /PageRank/ method.

provides that $\lambda_{2} \leq \alpha$ and if there are 2 or more irreducible subgraphs $\lambda_{2}=\alpha$.

This important for the rate of convergence of the algorithm.

**** DONE [#B] Community Based popularity cite:parkMiningWebMultiresolution  :modification:
A more general form of page rank using popularity scores dependent on a
community rating can be used to improve precision.
This is similar to the statsrank method cite:nemaConsensusbasedRankingWikipedia2017a
**** WAITING [#B] Linear Algebra behind Google cite:bryan250000002006        :insight:
A discussion on the algebra behind the pagerank method.
*** DONE Wikipedia
**** DONE [#A] Network analysis of user generated content quality in Wikipedia  cite:ingawaleNetworkAnalysisUser2013a

Is there a relationship between content quality and the structure of connections? Can high quality Wikipedia pages be used as a benchmark for the structure of connections.

The network structure of interactions between articles plays an important role in the emergence of quality.

High quality articles clusture in hubs.

**** DONE [#B] Using Wikipedia to alleviate data sparsity issues in Recommender Systems cite:loizouUsingWikipediaAlleviate2010a
For Recommender systems with limited access to data, Wikipedia can be used as an analogue with respect to connections to significantly improve performance.
*** DONE Page Rank
**** DONE General
***** DONE [#C] Inside PageRank cite:bianchiniPageRank2005                  :general:

This is a discussion on the stability, complexity and critical role of parameters involved in the computation.

- The page rank method will always converge for the random surfer eqref:eq:random-surfer provided that $\alpha < 1$ [[cite:bianchiniPageRank2005][\textsection 2.2]]

***** DONE [#C] survey of eigenvectors for web info cite:langvilleSurveyEigenvectorMethods2005 :general:
Many methods for web information retrival involve eigen vectors.

PageRank is impervious to spamming.
**** DONE Modification
***** DONE [#A] Ranking Nodes in Networks cite:berkhoutRankingNodesGeneral2018a :modification:
The choice of damping factor of Googles page rank might have a large impact on the values given to vertices.

This suggests an approach that uses structural network dynamics to provide an appropriate score distribution.

The method implemented is not something I have come yet to understand, but it could be very interesting to see:

- how it relates to the power walk method
- whether or not it could offer insightts into the convergence and stability of the power walk method
- Whether or not the method would be compatible with negatively weighted edges.

***** DONE [#A] Consensus based raking of Wikipedia cite:nemaConsensusbasedRankingWikipedia2017a :modification:
Google's page rank method can be improved by replacing the background probability of $\frac{1}{n}$ with statistics of usage, this is referred to as the StatsRank, this can be aggregated with user opinion to give the ConsensusRank

A limitation of this approach is that usage stats are only really available, in a neutral fashion for wikis, so too bad.

***** DONE [#B] Modified Page Rank Algorithm for Biology cite:zhangModifiedPageRankAlgorithm2018 :modification:

The page rank method can be used for modelling gene expression.

***** DONE [#B] Damping factor in Google Page Ranking cite:fuDampingFactorGoogle2006 :modification:
The damping factor is critical in changing a website's ranking in a search, this
modified algorithm, based on input-output ratio is proposed to substitute for
the damping factor.

It would be interesting to determine whether or not this type of a substitution
could improve the performance of the /power walk/ method and what implications
it would have on the method parameters and resulting convergence and stability.

**** DONE Performance
***** DONE [#A] A New Extrap method for PageRank computations cite:tanNewExtrapolationMethod2017a :performance:

A new algorithm can be used to improve the convergence rate of the power rank
method, compared to the /power method/ when the smoothing constant $\alpha$ is
near 1, when using the trace of a matrix.

***** DONE [#A] Reordering for the pagerank cite:langvilleReorderingPageRankProblem2006 :performance:
Reordering the pagerank problem and taking advantage of the fact that it is
sparse can allow for an improved algorithm that can potentially improve
performance or at worst offer no compromise in performance.
**** DONE Insight
***** DONE [#A] Power Series
****** DONE [#A] Page Rank Revisited cite:brinkmeierPageRankRevisited2006a :insight:
The Page Rank method can be expressed as a power series and an algorithm for
calculating the page rank can be derived, this corresponds to the /power method/
but offers insights into the mechanisms of the method.

A slightly faster algorithm is suggested at \textsection 6.3.

This is quite interesting because expressing the power walk method as a power
series may offer insights with respect to the convergence and stability of the
algorithm
****** DONE [#A] Page rank as a function of the damping factor cite:boldiPageRankFunctionDamping2005 :insight:

Demonstrates the behaviour of page rank for varying values of \alpha.

Values nearer to 1 do not give a more meaningful ranking.

Relate it toMcLaurin series Using iteration i.e. (the power rankmethod) gives the same exact result as the power series at the same step, similar to what was shown by brinkmeier cite:brinkmeierPageRankRevisited2006a

This could be useful in developing analytical methods to solve the pagerank problem.
***** DONE [#B] Small World for Random Surfers cite:mehrabianItSmallWorld2016 :insight:
Graphs can be generated in order to model real world networks, these models can
use the degree or page rank of a given vertex as a parameter to create the next
vertex in generating the graph.

This paper discusses upper and lower bounds for the diameter of a graph generated using random-surfer web-graph model.
***** DONE [#B] Centrality ranking in Multiplex Networks cite:dingCentralityRankingMultiplex2018 :insight:

A technique to measure node centrality for a multi-dimensional graph.

***** DONE [#C] PageRank of Integers                                        :insight:

*** TODO SEO
**** DONE [#A] Adaptive Methods for computation of page rank cite:kamvarAdaptiveMethodsComputation2004b :discoverability:
Given a graph, how can we optimise the discoverability of a node by introducing a couple of edges. A node is considered as discoverable if it:

1. Has a high page rank value
2. The number of steps to reach that vertex from another vertex is low.

**** DONE [#B] Maximizing Page Rank                                          :discoverability:insight:
