#+TITLE: Relationship of Model Parameters and Solution Stability in the Power Walk Page Rank Method.
Ok. The discovery project is meant to be more of a data analysis project, so say
that you will be investigating the relationship between the second eigenvalue
and the model and graph parameters.

#+end_quote

Much information is interconnected, be it an article, research paper, movie, books, personal notes, knowledge bases, peronal releationships etc., this interconnectivity creates a network which can naturally visualised as a graph.

Determining which vertex of this graph is centred is useful as it may assist in research, learning and collaborating. The /Page Rank/ method, which originally underpinned [[www.google.com][Google]], essentially asserts that the centre most vertex of a graph is the vertex that has the highest probability of being a destination after a random walk  cite:larrypageAnatomyLargescaleHypertextual1998, this method is popular, however, does not easily adapt to negatively weighted edges (which would suggest dissaproval as opposed to endorsement),  a limitation which is increasingly important as the area of /Sentiment Analysis/ within the field of /Text Mining/ is developed. cite:parkPowerWalkProceedings2013

The /Power Walk/ Method is similar to the /Random Surfer/ model but takes a different approach in order to accomadate the potential for an edge to have some real weight. cite:parkPowerWalkProceedings2013

This research project will be an investigation into the relationship between model parameters and the solution stability of the /Power Walk/ method.

** Motivation

Taking advantages of inter-related ideas allows for exploratory research which can promote both a deeper and broader understading of a topic, an example of this is the concept of a /pathfinder/, which is a list of central sources for a topic that can help in early stages of literature searches. cite:harbesonTeachingReferenceBibliography1972

A comprehensive review of the pathfinder approach, however, reveals that many such subject guides are not consistent with the needs of those engaging in research on any such topic. cite:vilenoPaperElectronicEvolution2007 This is issue is somewhat analogous to the issue faced by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in that the centrality of an article of information corresponds very greatly to it's relevance. cite:larrypageAnatomyLargescaleHypertextual1998

Using /Wikipedia/ can make for a very effective subject guide by following the various hyperlinks across wikipedia and leveraging [[https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Categories][Category Pages]] cite:HelpCategoriesMediaWiki in order to map out a topic, referring to references as necessary, a strategy even recommended by some [[https://mville.libguides.com/c.php?g=370066&p=2500344][Library Study Guides]] cite:moskowitzLibraryGuidesWikipedia, this strategy has even been implemented in recommendation systems to overcome a lack of data cite:loizouUsingWikipediaAlleviate2010a (see section #CITE).



to such an extent that some introductory texts in certain disciplines, such as law, even outright advise the use of an encyclopedia such as /WestLaw/ cite:WestlawAU before searching for material cite:bottNemesCossEffective2012.

The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_Knowledge_(software)][/Zettelkasten/ method]] of note taking essentially involves a collection of small interlinked notes cite:OverviewZettelkastenMethod, much like a wiki, within the last two decades this method has peaked in popularity cite:GoogleBooksNgram, despite being a method dating back to atleast the 18th Century. cite:haarkoetterAllesWesentlicheFindet This is clearly driven in party by the development of the internet, /HTML/ and the increasing breadth and depth of human knowledge.

** To Sort out
- Using Wikipedia to alleviate data sparsity issues in recommender systems
  - cite:loizouUsingWikipediaAlleviate2010a
  - The relationships in Wikipedia are very useful, we can use them sort of like a model, by mapping topics to articles and leveraging the interlinked pages we might be able to extrapolate that back out to useful recommendations.
- /Network analysis of usergenerated content quality in Wikipedia/
  + cite:ingawaleNetworkAnalysisUser2013a

** Question

/Can we determine the second eigenvalue from the method parameters? For
PageRank, the second eigenvalue is equal to the smoothing parameter \alpha/

#+begin_quote
Yes. An open question for the Power Walk method is, can we determine the second
eigenvalue from the method parameters? For PageRank, the second eigenvalue is
equal to the smoothing parameter \alpha. The second eigenvalue determines how
long the algorithm takes to converge and how stable the solution is. To begin,
implement the method for computing PageRank and then the Power Walk. It can all
be done using sparse matrices, so it only requires a fraction of the memory and
is each iteration is quick.

$$\begin{aligned} \Gamma = I - n D^{- 1}_B \\ \end{aligned}$$

Where we have the following:

$$\begin{aligned}
    \beta &= 10 \\
    B &= \beta^A \\
    A &=
    \begin{bmatrix}

0& 0& 0& 1 \\
0& 0& 1& 0
    \end{bmatrix} \\
     \implies
    B &= \begin{bmatrix}
     10 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
     1 & 10 & 1 & 1 \\
     1 & 1 & 10 & 1 \\

     0 & 0 & 13 & 0 \\
     0 & 0 & 0 & 13
     \end{bmatrix}  \\
     \text{Hence the Inverse is:}\\
     D_B^{-1}&= \frac{I}{13}\\
     \text{Putting it all together:}\\
     \Gamma &=  I - n D^{- 1}_B \\
     &= I - \frac{4 \cdot I}{13} \\
     &= \frac{9}{13} \cdot  I \\
     &= \begin{bmatrix}
