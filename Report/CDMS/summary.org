#+TITLE:  Summary

This report is an investigation into the application of the /Page Rank/
approach to measuring node centrality in networks.

The /Page Rank/ approach was initially developed as an integral component of
/Google/ and asserts that the centrality of a node can be measured by how likely
that node is to be traversed by mere chance. This report investigates the
underlying assumptions required to measure such a likelihood as well as
different approaches to measure it.

In order to study the limitations and behaviour of alternative /Page Rank/
approaches this report also investigate two different but common models for
networks and uses these models to simulate a variety of networks and consider
the /Page Rank/ measurements.
