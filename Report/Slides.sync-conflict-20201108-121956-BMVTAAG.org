* Introduction
This report was concerned with building on the page range approach of measuring node centrality in a graph, by investigating the /Power Walk/ method.

This required researching:

- The Mathematics of /PageRank/ and relationship to Markov Chains
- How */R/* implements:
  + Packages
  + Sparse Matrices
- Different algorithms to simulate graph structures.

* What is the /PageRank/
/PageRank/ is a measure of node centrality and is me the
