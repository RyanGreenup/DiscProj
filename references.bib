  abstract = {The basis of Google’s acclaimed PageRank is an artificial mixing of the Markov chain representing the connectivity structure of the network under study with a maximally connected network where every node is connected to every other node. The rate with which the original network is mixed with the strongly connected one is called damping factor. The choice of the damping factor can influence the ranking of the nodes. As we show in this paper, the ranks of transient nodes, i.e., nodes not belonging to a strongly connected component without outgoing links in the original network, tend to zero as the damping factor increases. In this paper we develop a new methodology for obtaining a meaningful ranking of nodes without having to resort to mixing the network with an artificial one. Our new ranking relies on an adjusted definition of the ergodic projector of the Markov chain representing the original network. We will show how the new ergodic projector leads to a more structural way of ranking (transient) nodes. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the impact of this new ranking approach.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a storage format for sparse matrices, called compressed sparse blocks (CSB), which allows both Ax and ATx to be computed efficiently in parallel, where A is an n × n sparse r(mictrahittmriicxsaulw-spietahtΘhn(nnleznn≥zg)tnwh)on, rokyniz(eseledroriinsaglanraudnpxnaiirnsaglaltedilmeisnems)eaonnf-dvΘeΘc((tn√onr.nz /lOg√unrn)alsglpgnao)n-, which is amply high for virtually any large matrix. The storage requirement for CSB is esssentially the same as that for the morestandard compressed-sparse-rows (CSR) format, for which computing Ax in parallel is easy but ATx is difficult. Benchmark results indicate that on one processor, the CSB algorithms for Ax and ATx run just as fast as the CSR algorithm for Ax, but the CSB algorithms also scale up linearly with processors until limited by offchip memory bandwidth.},

Specifically, the research sought to understand the concept, purposes and principles of pathfinders; the terminology representing pathfinders; the navigational pathway through the library Website to the pathfinders; and their common contents. Ten Canadian and ten American academic library Websites were sampled for pathfinders on three business topics: company, industry and marketing. Findings showed that the traditional term ‘pathfinder’ was not used on these academic Websites; instead ‘subject guides’ or ‘research guides’ were the most popular synonyms. The content analysis identified that subject guides have two basic functions, which are to facilitate access and to provide a search strategy. Four principles were found for creating Webmounted, subject guides: accessibility, consistency, selectivity, and transparency. The research also found that subject guides are important library finding tools as evidenced by the time and effort devoted to their creation, and their placement on valuable library homepage screen space.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {Purpose – Social media platforms allow near‐unfettered creation and exchange of user generated content (UGC). Drawing from network science, the purpose of this paper is to examine whether high and low quality UGC differ in their connectivity structures in Wikipedia (which consists of interconnected user generated articles). Design/methodology/approach – Using Featured Articles as a proxy for high quality, a network analysis was undertaken of the revision history of six different language Wikipedias, to offer a network‐centric explanation for the emergence of quality in UGC. Findings – The network structure of interactions between articles and contributors plays an important role in the emergence of quality. Specifically the analysis reveals that high‐quality articles cluster in hubs that span structural holes. Research limitations/implications – The analysis does not capture the strength of interactions between articles and contributors. The implication of this limitation is that quality is viewed as a binary variable. Extensions to this research will relate strength of interactions to different levels of quality in UGC. Practical implications – The findings help harness the “wisdom of the crowds” effectively. Organisations should nurture users and articles at the structural hubs from an early stage. This can be done through appropriate design of collaborative knowledge systems and development of organisational policies to empower hubs. Originality/value – The network centric perspective on quality in UGC and the use of a dynamic modelling tool are novel. The paper is of value to researchers in the area of social computing and to practitioners implementing and maintaining such platforms in organisations.},

Furthermore, we observe that these slow-converging pages are generally those pages with high PageRank. We use this observation to devise a simple algorithm to speed up the computation of PageRank, in which the PageRank of pages that have converged are not recomputed at each iteration after convergence. This algorithm, which we call Adaptive PageRank, speeds up the computation of PageRank by nearly 30\%.},

Though the power method is the initial measure to settle the PageRank problem, it gives poor convergence when the damping factor is sufficiently close to 1. This difficulty encourages researchers to present improved iterative methods for accelerating PageRank computations. In this paper, a cheap and practical extrapolation approach which is determined by the trace of the Google matrix is proposed, and it is more attractive when combined with the well-known Arnoldi-type algorithm. Convergence analysis of our algorithms is given. Numerical examples illustrate the efficiency of these accelerated schemes.},

  abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to provide a review of the literature on pathfinders, from the 1970s to the present. Design/methodology/approach – The paper reviews a range of publications which describe the methodology of pathfinders, provide practical advice and information, present research results, to aid librarians and library administrators in how to best manage the production and marketing of pathfinders. Findings – It was found that not much has been written on pathfinders. A few articles on traditional pathfinders were published between 1972 and 1995. In 1996, the electronic format took over. Most of the articles are of a practical nature although some describe empirical research. One void in the literature that has been found is librarians' lack of knowledge of users' needs and preferences. This results in much time and effort being dedicated to the production of pathfinders but without any consideration of users, thus discouraging them from using the available resources. Practical implications – This paper will be a useful source of information for librarians. It provides an overview of guidelines and best practices currently reported in the literature as well as the latest technical and educational trends. Originality/value – Such an extensive review of the literature on pathfinders has not been done before. It provides practical information for librarians wanting to embark on the production of pathfinders. It also identifies possible areas of future study.},
